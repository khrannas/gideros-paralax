This project is based from http://giderosmobile.com/forum/discussion/387/parallax-background

All thanks to Adnaan(for creating code snippet) and Teranth(for creating a class and cleaning code).

For use this code, add ParaBG.lua to your project.
Set image you want to add as paralax background

	local bgs = {
		bg1 = "bg1.png",
		bg2 = "bg2.png",
		...
	}

then instantiate the class using
	
	local bg = ParaBG.new(bgs, 3)

it will create paralax background with speed 3 after that add bg to the scene

	stage:addChild(bg)

That's it. Insert as many layer to your background.
